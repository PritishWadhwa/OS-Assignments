Multiple changes would be required in the long_add function so that it is able to 
run in the 64 bit system. The changes required are:

1.) All the registers used in the long_add function are the ones which can take in only 32 bit entries.
those would be reuired to be changed
2.) In 32 bit just for the sake of it, I have used stack pointers whereas in 64 bit I have used registers
to store the addends for computing sum. This is just for a little variety in code and without it also, the code can run.

The above two points were the changes in my code. Apart from these, there would be a difference
int the commands used for compileing them.

For long_add, the commands would be:
	nasm -felf32 P4_1.asm -o P4_1.o
	gcc -m32 P4_1.o P4.c -o P4_1
	./P4_1

whereas for extended_add, the commands would be:
	nasm -felf64 P4_2.asm -o P4_2.o
	gcc P4_2.o P4.c -o P4_2
	./P4_2
