For increasing efficiency, Long mode generally uses virtual addresses,
multiple protective protocols and segmentation and paging protocols. 
All this will cost some amount of memory. 
However according to the question, we only have 320KB of RAM available.
So using long mode would reduce the actual RAM available for our use.
In the long mode, multiple libraries and drivers are present to increase 
efficiency which eventually take up memory. 
Since there is a restriction of 320KB RAM one should avoid such memory 
costly features. 
16 bit only has physical addressing and a simpler structure thus, 
giving us higher amount of usable RAM out of the available 320KB. 
Also, general size of memory pointer in long mode (64 bit) is 8 bytes as
compared to the 2 bytes of real mode(16 bit). 
Since memory pointer in long mode is 4 times more, it will only use up more memory 
to store a single address thus by using real mode we would be able to use 
more storage.

Therefore due to the above reasons I will prefer real mode (16 bit mode only) 
however in case there are specific requirements like using long data type or any 
other requirements which require large 64 bit registers and/or better efficiency 
of data then I will prefer 64 bit (long) mode.
