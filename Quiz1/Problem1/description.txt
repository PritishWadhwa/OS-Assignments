1. The C Program:- 
The C program named P1_c.c is a C prpgram that contains a main function. 
In the main function,two variables of data type long are initialized and are stored 
with some values in them.
Then these two variables are passed as arguments during the function call of checkGreater.

2. The Assembly Program:- 
In the assembly program, both _start and checkgreater have been made global functions.
The start function writes two integer values in rsi and rdi registers which are
then passed to the checkGreater function. 
The check greater function compares the data present in rdi and rsi registers (calculating rsi-rdi), 
and if rsi-rdi is less than or equal to 0 (x <= y) then the jl (jump if lesser) is met and 
the control goes to the function named smaller from where 0 is printed using relevant syntax,
if jl is not met then the control jumps to the function named larger (since x>y) 
and 1 gets printed. 
The ".rodata" section helps in building the messages("0" or "1") that are required to print
